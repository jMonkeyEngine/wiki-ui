# This file can be used to configure the Node.js build for Antora ui without
# having Node installed locally. See 'setup-docs/setup.adoc' in the root of this
# repo for details of how to use this file.
#
# The action add-and-commit will commit package-lock.json and package.json if
# changes are made to the files.
#
# If the package-lock.json or package.json files are updated or new depends are
# installed, the 'npm ci' should be always ran thereafter to speed up build
# times. When ci is active, the package-lock.json and package.json files in root
# will not be updated.
